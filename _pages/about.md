Hi! I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at BUPT, where I am lucky to be advised by [Dr. Yuchao Zhang](yuchaozhang.weebly.com).
Before that, I earned my M.Eng degree in Computer Technology from Soochow University, where I was grateful to be supervised by [Prof. Jin Wang](http://web.suda.edu.cn/wjin1985/index.html). Piror to that, I received double B.S. degrees in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University and Computer Science & Technology from Yangzhou University in 2020, respectively. My research interests include **blockchain security**, **coded computing** and **distributed systems**.<br>

I would love to work with all people together on some interesting projects! **Feel free to drop me an email** if you have any ideas about blockchain to discuss!
